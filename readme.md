This app monitors the [Binance](https://www.binance.com) cryptocurrency exchange in search of triangle arbitrage opportunities.

## The HUD
The HUD is the chart displayed above. It can be painted at a configurable interval to show snapshots of currently detected
arbitrage opportunities. To disable the HUD, set `HUD_REFRESH_INTERVAL` to 0.

### Reading the HUD
* **Trade** - Symbols involved in the triangle arbitrage. The first must be converted into the second, which must be converted into the third, and then back to the first.
* **Profit** - Percent profit or loss from executing the triangle arbitrage. This does not include trading fees.
* **AB Time** - Timestamp of the most recent market update for the ticker relating the first and second symbols in the arbitrage.
* **BC Time** - Timestamp of the most recent market update for the ticker relating the second and third symbols in the arbitrage.
* **CA Time** - Timestamp of the most recent market update for the ticker relating the third and first symbols in the arbitrage.
* **Age** - Time in seconds since the least recently updated market ticker involved in the triangle arbitrage.
